## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"javac: command not found"**
```bash
# Check if Java is installed
java -version
javac -version

# If not installed, download from:
# https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
```

**"Error: Could not find or load main class"**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the src directory
pwd
ls *.java

# Recompile all files
javac *.java

# Run with correct class name
java ATM  # (not ATM.java)
```

**"Exception in thread 'main'"**
```bash
# Check for compilation errors first
javac *.java

# Look for error messages and fix syntax issues
```

### File Structure Check:
```bash
# Verify all required files exist
ls -la
# Should show: Account.java, AccountService.java, AccountTest.java, ATM.java, Transaction.java
```
